### What is Docker?
- Open source platform
- Enables us to separate applications from infrastructure
- Allows us to deliver software faster
- Written in GO (language)
### Why learn Docker?
- Multi billion dollar companies are using or adopting Docker e.g. Ebay, Netflix,
Sky, and many more
- Docker adoption was anticipated to be 50% by the end of 2020
- Lightweight and user friendly
- Shares resources with OS as opposed to using the OS completely (as is the case
  with VM's)
- Docker engine connects the container with OS and only uses the resources required
- VM works with Hypervisor to connect guest OS/VM with Host OS/server

### Docker API
### DockerHub
- DockerHub repo required to see the container or image
- Wrapped up container can be pulled and ran on any OS
